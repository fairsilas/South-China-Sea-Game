### Character Creation
- In "Junks & Riches," you assume the role of a struggling fisherman, sailor, or peddler, each of whom faces unique challenges in the 18th century South China Sea. This screen will provide a small historical description of each coastal profession.

- Fishermen, often born into impoverished coastal communities, found themselves grappling with dwindling fish stocks and increased competition for resources. The oppressive Qing government imposed heavy taxes and regulations on their trade, pushing many into poverty. Faced with few alternatives, some fishermen turned to piracy as a desperate bid for survival and a means to escape the shackles of poverty.

- Sailors, whether on merchant vessels or imperial navy ships, contended with harsh living conditions, low wages, and the risk of encountering pirates on the high seas. Their lives were marred by the strict discipline imposed by Qing officials, and they too often found themselves ensnared in the cycle of oppression. This environment made some sailors susceptible to the allure of piracy, as it offered an opportunity for both wealth and rebellion against their oppressors.

- Peddlers, engaged in the trade of goods and commodities, faced the complexities of the Canton System's strict regulations. Profit margins were thin, and the constant threat of pirate raids further imperiled their livelihoods. Frustration with the system and the desire for financial stability sometimes led peddlers to cross over to the pirate's life, where opportunities for greater wealth and autonomy could be found.

- In "Junks & Riches," you'll experience the hardship of a working class citizen on China's coasts.

  [^1]: Most of the lower ranked pirates came from poor backgrounds such as fisherfolk and Sailors or unsuccessful traders. Pirates were typically young single men in 20s and rarely over 40. Poverty drove them to commit crimes as a way to survive and escape from the oppressive Qing government. (Antony 45 full citation needed here.)

## II. Setting and Background

### Historical Context

The game is set against the backdrop of the 18th century South China Sea Coast, a period marked by the proliferation of piracy in Chinese waters. This era was defined by its complex socio-economic and political landscape, making it fertile ground for piracy to take root and flourish. Several key elements shape this historical context:

**1. The Canton System:**
   - The game world is deeply influenced by the Canton System, which was established by the Qing Dynasty. This system regulated foreign trade, primarily at the port of Canton (modern-day Guangzhou). Foreign merchants were restricted to conducting trade through a designated area, which was closely monitored by Qing officials. The tight control of trade created conditions conducive to smuggling, as people sought to circumvent these trade restrictions.

**2. Ports of Significance:**
   - **Macao:** Your journey begins in Macao, an essential hub for international trade. Macao's unique status as a Portuguese enclave in Chinese territory made it a haven for pirates and smugglers, operating with a degree of autonomy.
   - **Guangzhou (Canton):** As one of the most prominent trading ports during the Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou played a central role in the game's world. It was a vital connection point for foreign merchants and served as a focal point for various historical events, including confrontations between the Qing authorities and pirates.

**3. Hainan Island - Pirate Base:**
   - Hainan Island serves as a key location in the game, housing one of the most notorious pirate bases in the region. The island's strategic position allowed pirates to operate in proximity to major trade routes. It was from this base that pirates launched their attacks on merchant ships and nearby coastal towns.

**4. The Tay Son Rebellion:**
   - The Tay Son Rebellion, a historical conflict taking place during the late 18th century, provides additional context to the game world. As the rebellion swept through parts of Vietnam, it influenced the rise of several prominent pirate leaders, who played a role in the conflict. Characters will reference this rebellion, offering insights into the interconnectedness of regional events and the emergence of pirates as significant players in the power struggle.

**5. Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao and Cui Zhi:**
   - Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao and her formidable confederation of pirates, as well as the cunning and ruthless Cui Zhi, who played a crucial role in orchestrating pirate operations, are historical figures that have left a lasting impact on the region. These characters, though not likely to be encountered in the game, will be mentioned by other NPCs, contributing to the authenticity of the historical setting.

**6. The Gulf of Tonkin:**
   - The Gulf of Tonkin, a significant geographical feature, had a critical role in the operations of the pirates as a result of the Tay Son rebellion. Situated in the northern part of the South China Sea, it provided a crucial maritime passage connecting the southern coast of China with the northeastern coast of Vietnam where Chinese Pirates who joined the Tay Son rebellion could stop and trade, or get provisions and support from the rebels. This proximity allowed pirates to establish a stronghold in the Gulf of Tonkin, from which they could launch their raids on passing merchant vessels. The Gulf of Tonkin acted as a strategic arena for piracy, with its intricate network of islands, bays, and open waters providing ample opportunities for pirate operations. Hainan island was one of those islands located in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Through  dialogue and interactions with NPCs, players will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the  historical background of the 18th century South China Sea Coast, learning of the challenges and motivations that shaped the lives of Qing officials, and pirates during this era.

## III. Gameplay Mechanics
### beginning/intro
### Core Gameplay Loop
- Starting in a port near a market with an inventory based on your chosen role. 
- Daily activities of trading, acquiring food, and maintaining your crew. In order to progress, you must travel between key trading ports and pirate stashes, overcoming obstacles at sea with each journey and trading goods to increase your wealth, plundering ships, or doing contractual missions for the Qing officials or the Confederation of pirates.

### Pirate Crew Interaction
- In "Junks & Riches," you'll get the chance to join a small pirate crew early in the game. The 18th-century South China Sea was rife with desperation due to poverty, heavy taxes, and Qing government oppression, making recruitment into piracy relatively easy[^2].
- Your choices in the game have lasting consequences. If you're not careful, both pirate and Qing officials might scrutinize your ship's identity, putting a bounty on your head. Traveling without a safe conduct pass might result in pirate attacks and cargo theft, while sailing without Qing Government registration could lead to encounters with the Qing navy and potential arrest[^3]. This reflects the harsh reality of piracy in this historical setting.

[^2]: (Antony 102)
[^3]: The pirate confederacy had established a structured protection racket. Even salt traders employed by the Qing state were compelled to purchase "safe conduct passes" at a cost of 200 Spanish silver dollars per vessel. These passes were obtainable at ports situated in significant trading hubs and villages, frequently in proximity to prominent political centers. This situation highlights the pervasive corruption within Qing officials and the considerable influence wielded by the confederacy. (Antony page 38 full Citation needed)

### Naval Combat
- engage in naval combat that faithfully mirrors the realities of the 18th century South China Sea. You'll take control of your ship, utilizing a top-down view and steering with WASD keys or arrow keys. Most of the controls will be point and click so a mouse is recommended for gameplay.

- One such weapon is the 'wallpiece,' a swiveling cannon mounted to maximize its range of motion. Typically used at close range, these swivel guns allowed for formidable firepower in naval encounters[^2]. Another weapon featured is the 'fowling piece,' originally designed for bird hunting. With barrels reaching up to six feet for maximum accuracy, these long shotguns were adapted for warfare and wielded by the Chinese military and pirates alike[^3].

## V. Progression and Objectives

### Pirate Organizations and Communal Stash

In the world of South China Pirates, pirate organizations were not just bands of lawless individuals but rather structured entities with their own rules, hierarchies, and a communal stash. Understanding this system is vital for players to thrive in the game.

- **Pirate Hierarchy:**
  - Pirate organizations had leaders, often referred to as "Pirate Chieftains." These leaders were responsible for making strategic decisions and assigning roles within the crew. Some pirate leaders came from merchant backgrounds, and their business acumen often made them successful.

- **Communal Stash:**
  - Pirate organizations maintained a communal stash where the plundered wealth was stored. This communal stash was a shared treasury accessible to all members, serving as a vital resource for the group's survival and expansion.

- **Wealth Accumulation:**
  - A key objective for players is to contribute to the communal stash. By accumulating wealth through various means, such as raiding ships, looting villages, or trading contraband, players strengthen their pirate organization and contribute to its growth.

- **Leaderboard and Prestige:**
  - The game features a leaderboard that displays the top contributors to the communal stash. The more wealth a player accumulates and deposits into the communal stash, the higher their score on the leaderboard. Achieving a high position in the rankings grants players prestige and recognition within the pirate organization.

- **Rules and Regulations:**
  - Pirate organizations operated under a set of rules and regulations. These rules could include the division of spoils, codes of conduct, and penalties for insubordination. Players must adhere to these rules to maintain their standing within the group.

- **Decision-Making and Alliances:**
  - The communal stash could be used to make crucial decisions. Players may vote on alliances with other pirate organizations, fortifying strongholds, or choosing new targets for raids. A portion of the communal stash might be allocated to negotiating alliances, diplomacy, and defense.

- **Strategic Investments:**
  - Players can use their accumulated wealth to invest in improving the organization's infrastructure, upgrading ships, and strengthening their position within the pirate hierarchy.

In South China Pirates, the communal stash is not just a treasure chest; it's the lifeblood of the pirate organization. Players must strive to accumulate wealth, follow the rules, and work together to become legendary pirates and dominate the leaderboard.
