### beginning/intro
### Core Gameplay Loop
- Starting in a port near a market with an inventory based on your chosen role. 
- Daily activities of trading, acquiring food, and maintaining your crew. In order to progress, you must travel between key trading ports and pirate stashes, overcoming obstacles at sea with each journey and trading goods to increase your wealth, plundering ships, or doing contractual missions for the Qing officials or the Confederation of pirates.

### Pirate Crew Interaction
- You are given the opportunity to join a small crew of pirates in the beginning of the game. The captain dies and you take his place. People were desperate for an escape from poverty and harsh taxes and oppression imposed by the Qing government, so finding people who were willing to turn to piracy was not as difficult as one might expect.[^2]
- Consequences of your choices, your ships identifiction may be checked by pirates or Qing officials and a  bounty may be placed on your head. Travelling without a safe conduct pass could lead to pirates attacking your ship and stealing your cargo. Travelling without registration with the Qing Government may lead to run ins with Qing navy and your arrest.
[^2]: The pirate confederacy had established a structured protection racket. Even salt traders employed by the Qing state were compelled to purchase "safe conduct passes" at a cost of 200 Spanish silver dollars per vessel. These passes were obtainable at ports situated in significant trading hubs and villages, frequently in proximity to prominent political centers. This situation highlights the pervasive corruption within Qing officials and the considerable influence wielded by the confederacy. (Antony page 38 full Citation needed)
