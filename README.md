# Junks & Riches: An 1800s South China Sea Trading Game

## About This Document
This planning document will go over everything included in my game project, and give historical context for the items, characters, and locations, and events in the game. 
The first half of the document goes over the design of the game, and the second half goes over historical information used to come to the decision to add each aspect of the game.

**A few things to consider when reading this document:**
1. Many of the locations and mechanics mentioned will not be added within the timeframe, but are guides for development and future development.
2. The images used are taken from gameplay and all graphics are my own drawings, except for the temporary title screen background which as AI generated.
3. At the end there will be a development log with a walkthrough of the latest features added.

### Title Screen

### Character Creation
- In "Junks & Riches," you start by customizing your character by choosing a labor position. You are limited to 3 starting jobs.

Based what I read in "Pirate Nations: Maritime Pirates as Escape Societies in Late Imperial China." by MacKay, Joseph.

- Fishermen, in coastal communities, often found themselves struggling with dwindling fish stocks and increased competition for resources. The oppressive Qing government imposed heavy taxes and regulations on their trade, pushing many into poverty. Faced with few alternatives, some fishermen turned to piracy as a way to survive and make a better life for themselves. 

- Sailors, whether on merchant vessels or imperial navy ships, dealt with harsh living conditions dangerous voyages, low wages, and the risk of encountering pirates on the high seas. Another reason sailors joined is because they were valuable to the pirates, with the knowledge of how to navigate or work on a ship they were sought out by pirates to help sail junks.

- Merchant/Peddler, would engaged in the trade of goods and commodities, but because many were included in the Cohong of Hong merchants in the Canton System, they could not trade with foreigners and were restricted in what they could trade. Profit margins were thin, and the constant threat of pirate raids further threatened their livelihoods. Frustration with the system and the desire for financial stability sometimes led peddlers and merchants to cross over to the pirate's life, where greater opportunities could be found. Merchants were often more rich than farmers or fishermen, but they were looked down on in Chinese Society and thought to contribute nothing to the good of the collective as a farmer or fisherman would.

- In "Junks & Riches," you'll experience the hardship of a working class citizen on China's coasts.

- Choose a character name (This will be used as an ID for saving your score on the leaderboard)
  
  [^1]: Most of the lower ranked pirates came from poor backgrounds such as fishermen and Sailors or merchants. Pirates were typically young single men in 20s and rarely over 40. Poverty drove them to commit crimes as a way to survive and escape from the oppressive Qing government. **Antony, Robert J. _The Golden Age of Piracy in China, 1520-1810: A Short History with Documents. 38-39. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 2022.**

## Setting and Background
### Historical Context

The game is set against the backdrop of the 18th century South China Sea Coast, a period marked by the proliferation of piracy in Chinese waters. The locations added to the game are the places most mentioned in sources talking about piracy at that time.

**The Canton System:**
   - The game world is influenced by the Canton System, which was established by the Qing Dynasty. This system regulated foreign trade, primarily at the port of Canton (modern-day Guangzhou). Foreign merchants were restricted to conducting trade through a designated area, which was closely monitored by Qing officials. The tight control of trade created conditions conducive to smuggling, as people sought to circumvent these trade restrictions.

**The Tay Son Rebellion:**
   - The Tay Son Rebellion, a historical conflict taking place during the late 18th century, provides additional context to the game world. As the rebellion swept through parts of Vietnam, it influenced the rise of several prominent pirate leaders, who played a role in the conflict. Characters will reference this rebellion, offering insights into the interconnectedness of regional events and the emergence of pirates as significant players in the power struggle.

**Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao and Cui Zhi:**
   - Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao and her formidable confederation of pirates, as well as the benevolant Cui Zhi, who played a crucial role in orchestrating pirate operations, are historical figures that have left a lasting impact on the region. These characters, though not likely to be encountered in the game, will be mentioned by other NPCs, contributing to the authenticity of the historical setting.

**The Gulf of Tonkin:**
   - The Gulf of Tonkin, a significant geographical feature, had a critical role in the operations of the pirates as a result of the Tay Son rebellion. Situated in the northern part of the South China Sea, it provided a crucial maritime passage connecting the southern coast of China with the northeastern coast of Vietnam where Chinese Pirates who joined the Tay Son rebellion could stop and trade, or get provisions and support from the rebels. This proximity allowed pirates to establish a stronghold in the Gulf of Tonkin, from which they could launch their raids on passing merchant vessels. The Gulf of Tonkin acted as a strategic arena for piracy, with its intricate network of islands, bays, and open waters providing ample opportunities for pirate operations. Hainan island was one of those islands located in the Gulf of Tonkin.
   - 
Through  dialogue and interactions with NPCs, players will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the  historical background of the 18th century South China Sea Coast, learning of the challenges and motivations that shaped the lives of Qing officials, and pirates during this era.

## III. Gameplay Mechanics
### Beginning
 - Start the game by selecting a starting character. Sailor, Fisherman, or Trader.
 You start with a set of items in your inventory depending on what you choose a fisherman might start with some fish, a knife and a fishing pole. or something like this:
![image](https://github.com/fairsilas/South-China-Sea-Game/assets/78548914/d7302ba8-504b-4564-9da4-61e2c68cc429)
 You will start in your home village where you will need to fish, or do some other job in order to get enough rice to feed your family and pay your taxes. Your uncle comes to visit and hopes to use your expertise on a trip to Macau to rob cargo ship. When take him up on it you go to Macau and wait until dark to loot a ship on the shore. After taking it back to your home village your uncle has found enough silver to retire and move away so he elects you to lead his crew.

### Core Gameplay Loop
- Daily activities of trading, acquiring food, and maintaining your crew.(Must feed and pay your crew to travel between locations.) In order to progress, you must travel between key trading ports and stash for the fleet you join, overcoming obstacles at sea with each journey and trading goods to increase your wealth, plundering ships, killing and looting, or terrorizing a small village and forcing them to pay tribute to your fleet.
- 

### Pirate Crew Interaction
- According to Robert J. Antony, in  it was not hard to convert people to piracy, and the number of pirates recorded shows that many people participated in piracy in the early 1800s. 
- Your choices in the game have lasting consequences. If you're not careful, both pirate and Qing officials might scrutinize your ship's identity, putting a bounty on your head. Traveling without a safe conduct pass might result in pirate attacks and cargo theft, while sailing without Qing Government registration could lead to encounters with the Qing navy and potential arrest. This reflects the harsh reality of piracy in this historical setting.
- 

### Naval Combat
- Engage in naval combat that mirrors the realities of the 18th century South China Sea. You'll take control of your ship, utilizing a top-down view and steering with WASD keys or arrow keys. Most of the controls will be point and click so a mouse is recommended for gameplay. The weapons used will be taken from various sources including the firsthand account of John Turner, a foreigner who was kidnapped by pirates and wrote about the experience.In the game combat will be done by selecting the weapon on your boat that you would like to use and clicking to use it. (Weapons vary, the distance, and precision of aiming depends on what you are using.) Here a couple weapons used during the era:

- **'wallpiece,'** a swiveling cannon mounted to maximize its range of motion. Typically used at close range, these swivel guns allowed for quick adjustments of aim. Another weapon featured is the **'fowling piece,'** originally designed for bird hunting. With barrels reaching up to six feet for maximum accuracy, these long shotguns were adapted for warfare and wielded by the Chinese military and pirates alike.

- There were several types of cannons, some fired larger cannonballs, some fired grapeshot, and some fired small cannonballs. The different types of cannons were used depending on the range, and the level of maneuverability needed and can each be traded for and used in combat in the game. The rate of fire for weapons depends on the numer owned by the player. For example if you have 1 cannon it takes a while to reload and fire again, but if you have 10, you can fire much faster while the other cannons are being reloaded.

- John Turner, an English sailor, describes his experience being kidnapped and ransomed. He was taken captive by Zheng Yi's crew from a British ship sailing from India in 1806. He wrote a 20-page account of his experience in 1809 including a section on the weapons used at the time.

- **Qing Navy Cannonballs:** The cannonballs used by the Qing Navy were described as weighing "1 catty," which is approximately equivalent to 1.3 pounds. These cannonballs were used with the cannons on Qing Navy warships.

- **Pirate Cannonballs:** According to the account of John Turner, a On the other hand, pirate ships in the region were noted to use heavier cannonballs. Specifically, the notes mentioned that pirate cannonballs weighed "14 catty," which is approximately equivalent to 18 pounds. These larger cannonballs were used with the cannons on pirate junks.
- This screenshot from the game shows the player shooting a cannonball at another junk.

### Trading System
- Dynamic trade system influenced by historical trends, supply, and demand.
- Players can sometimes force ships to sell their cargo at low prices through threats in the complex multiple choice dialogue system.
- Without registration with the Qing officials, you will be hassled by Qing officials
- Without membership in a fleet of the confederation of pirates, you may be plundered by pirates.
- This screenshot shows the way trade works. If a trader values items selected from your inventory higher than items from their inventory then they will accept the trade. 
  ![image](https://github.com/fairsilas/South-China-Sea-Game/assets/78548914/129d57c8-db38-47da-a173-d0d81b649beb)
### Simulation Aspects
- The game will include several jobs that players can try out, including pearl diving which before the invention of artificial pearls was something done on China's coasts. You may also try fishing, or working on your family's farm.


### Character Interaction
- Dialogue with various characters featuring multiple response choices. This allows for player interactions to be culturally appropriate and better understand the systems of trade and communication in 1800s China.
- This screenshot demonstrates the multiple dialogue options, although in many cases the choice will be more impactful. For instance you can use it to haggle for lower prices before proposing a trade:
![image](https://github.com/fairsilas/South-China-Sea-Game/assets/78548914/51f70b9c-e4eb-4783-84eb-0bdfde8d915d)

### Barter and Currency System
- Barter system for trading items with traders.
- Use of copper coins, silver Taels, and other forms of currency.
- Barter system assigns a value to every item differently for each trader. Typically for international trade, China was trading actual goods for silver or opium. So, Chinese merchants often value silver higher than foreigners, but foreigners value most goods higher than Chinese traders would. So trading with foregners has greater profit margins, but also comes with more risk. As trade of opium was banned in 1800, and unlicensed trade with foreigners was also illegal.
- In the screenshot below, you can see the copper coins are added like any other item in your inventory, however, the price of copper stays fairly standardized. A lot of the prices for items are measured based off of how many copper coins they are worth. (The number on the items are the quantity. Price only appears when you are trading.)
- ![image](https://github.com/fairsilas/South-China-Sea-Game/assets/78548914/35fa0d5b-9a90-4a70-b34f-4f7bbdb0988f)

### Bounty/Reputation
- The Qing Navy and Guangdong Pirate Confederacy each separately can have a bounty on you. Additionally, you have a general reputation, which if it is bad enough can scare people into surrendering or if good can get people to trust you.

### Navigate Qing Dynasty's Policies
- Interact with Qing officials and tax collectors. Build up a bounty and become Qing Dynasty's #1 enemy, or try to avoid conflict.

### Pirate Taxation Systems
- Choices to enforce or evade pirate taxation, impacting relationships with pirate organizations and the Qing Dynasty. Without proper safe conduct passes and licencing for your ship you will be attacked or plundered by pirates.

## IV. Historical Figures

### Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao
- The Red banner fleet was the largest of the Gulf of Tonkin confederation. You will have the opportunity to interact with a part of her fleet and learn about the dynamics of the confederacy. The fleet will operate and be structured based on the official Guangdong Pirate Pact Document. Which includes detailed codes of conduct which enforce rules on members. The basic idea is a communal stash that is distributed based on rank and how much you contribute. If you get greedy and take from the stash or rob a boat that has paid for a safe conduct pass you will be punished by losing your position, and often death.
- Discover the strange relationship between Zheng I, Zheng Pao, ang Zheng I Sao. Zheng Pao was kidnapped as a kid and worked as a sex servant for Zheng Yi. He was then adopted as Zheng Yi's son. After Zheng I died, Zheng Yi Sao and Zheng Pao were in a relationship. 
- 

### Cui Zhi 'the Benevolent Thief'
- Integration of this historical figure as an example of piracy as an escape from Qing taxation. Introduced as a Sailors tale of a benevolent pirate who only took from the rich and only took half of their goods. Despite Qing policy being very harsh for piracy, usually death, this shows how the common people still sometimes viewed pirates as legends or heroes.

### Pirate Mo Guanfu
- Mo guanfu was a pirate who was caught and killed. he was a part of the Tay Son rebellion. To show the brutality of the Qing governments punishment of pirates, his execution will be an event in the game.

## V. Progression and Objectives

### Pirate Organizations and Communal Stash

In the 1800s South China Sea, pirate organizations were not just bands of lawless individuals but rather structured entities with their own rules, hierarchies, and a communal wealth that was distributed thoughtfully. Understanding this system is vital for players to thrive in the game as they choose which fleet to join or how to succeed on their own.

- **Pirate Hierarchy:**
  - Pirate organizations had leaders, often referred to as "Pirate Chieftains." These leaders were responsible for making strategic decisions and assigning roles within the crew. Some pirate leaders came from merchant backgrounds, and were already wealthy, but their already low standing in the confucian social hierarchy and their connections in black-markets made piracy an appealing thing to turn to. 

- **Communal Stash:**
  - Pirate organizations maintained a communal stash where the plundered wealth was stored. This communal stash was a shared treasury accessible to all members, serving as a vital resource for the group's survival and expansion. If a crew member tried to keep wealth to themselves, they would be killed, or if they stole from the community. If you break those guidelines, you bounty for the Pirate Confederacy will go up and you will be attacked by pirates more often.
  - Through the same trade menu as when trading with a person, you may trade items with the communal stash. The only difference is there are no prices, because the stash is not sentient so you can trade freely any items you want.
   ![image](https://github.com/fairsilas/South-China-Sea-Game/assets/78548914/911bd259-dcaf-4a80-ab0e-01fb8cb67f71)

- **Wealth Accumulation:**
  - A key objective for players is to contribute to the communal stash. By accumulating wealth through various means, such as raiding ships, looting villages, or trading contraband, players strengthen their pirate organization and contribute to its growth. This stash is located somewhere secure and hard to find and it is guarded by people from the fleet that stash is for. By exploring you may stumble across another fleet's stash and loot it but they will come after you.
  - ![image](https://github.com/fairsilas/South-China-Sea-Game/assets/78548914/b59ff98d-aa83-4fe2-8aea-64337e068f40)

- **Leaderboard:**
  - The game features a leaderboard that displays the top contributors to the communal stash. The more wealth a player accumulates and deposits into the communal stash, the higher their score on the leaderboard. Achieving a high position in the rankings grants players prestige and recognition within the pirate organization.

- **Rules and Regulations:**
  - As talked about before, the rules for the Qing Dynasty are determined by primary documents like the Guangdong Pirate Pact, and Qing legal documents which have specific rules and punishments, but both are comparable in terms of brutality.

- **Strategic Investments:**
  - Players can use their accumulated wealth to invest in improving weapons or items for trade, and can upgrade their ship to carry more cargo. But by carrying items with you you risk being robbed, or dying and having to start. Your items that you store are saved even if you die.

### Exploration and Travel
- Moving between areas using a Node-Based map.
- To maintain your crew you need to provide food and pay, so to start a journey there will be a cost to pay each time. This feature is not yet added but will appear on this minimap page.

### Chronological Events
- Game events follow a chronological order, with dates changing as events unfold. Most take place between 1800 and 1810. This is when piracy reached its peak, and had its downfall.

## VI. Special Features

### Leaderboards
- Online leaderboards for accumulated wealth, implemented using the Easy Leaderboard extension. The database and site is already set up, so all I need to do us upload and update scores and display them on the game menu if you view the leaderboard.

### Historical Background and Sources
---

**Safe Conduct Passes**
: The pirate confederacy had established a structured protection racket. Even salt traders employed by the Qing state were compelled to purchase "safe conduct passes" at a cost of 200 Spanish silver dollars per vessel. These passes were obtainable at ports situated in significant trading hubs and villages, frequently in proximity to prominent political centers. This situation highlights the corruption within Qing officials and the considerable influence wielded by the confederacy.

**Postal Communication in 1800s China: Coordinating Through Letters**
: In 1800s China, people communicated primarily through private letters. Letters were delivered by friends, messengers, or urban letter shops. The origins of this system remain uncertain, but it allowed for effective coordination despite high illiteracy rates and lack of modern transportation or a centralized postal system. This decentralized approach reflected the dynamic nature of communication during the time.

**Macao**
: Macao, a prominent trading port during the 19th century, played a crucial role in the foreign trade system with China. It was the place where traders would stay before going to Canton for trade. In Canton, foreign merchants formed a separate community, while a specialized guild known as the Co-hong on the Chinese side held a monopoly over trade with these foreigners. The Co-hong merchants paid substantial sums to the emperor for the privilege of engaging in foreign trade and profited significantly from this exclusive access. The Qing emperor, despite maintaining a certain distance from foreign traders, derived substantial personal revenue from the duties collected from trade, directly benefiting the imperial household. The foreign merchants, required to reside in a designated quarter of the city, lived in structures called "factories," which functioned as living quarters, warehouses, and trade offices. The Thirteen Factories, lining the waterfront, housed British, Austrian, Danish, Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, and American merchants, creating a diverse trading environment. Macao remained a hub in the intricate web of foreign trade with China. Which is why it was added as a location in the game.

**Fowling Piece:**
: In the 1800s, during the era of piracy and rebellion in China, the use of firearms, particularly the "bird gun" or "fowling piece," likely originated from its initial use in hunting birds, but it found a place in more combative settings as well.

:  The introduction of the matchlock gun to China occurred during the Jiajing period of the Ming dynasty (1521-1567) in the early sixteenth century. Despite the transformative impact of firearms on warfare, the matchlock or bird gun did not become the predominant weapon during the Ming and Qing periods. The state's indifference towards small arms had significant implications for the circulation of these weapons in society, limiting their adoption by civilians.

: While firearms like bird guns were not widespread among outlaws, bandits, and rebels during the Qing dynasty, they did have a presence. The Conspectus of Penal Cases, a collection of Qing criminal cases, documented relatively few instances of bird gun homicides before the nineteenth century. Criminals with lethal intent typically favored nonexplosive weapons such as swords, knives, and daggers. So pirates likely used these guns but more commonly they had swords, daggers, or long spear like weapons to attack from a distance.
