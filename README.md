## Setting:
The game is set in the South China Sea region, primarily focusing on Canton ports and surrounding areas, during the decades around 1800.

Learn about the structure and system of the Confederacy of pirates through those encounters.

### 2.	Cui Zhi 'the Benevolent Thief':

Players may encounter Mo Guanfu in various ways, perhaps witnessing his trial and hanging, or encountering him as an NPC.
