### Character Creation
- In "Junks & Riches," you assume the role of a struggling fisherman, sailor, or peddler, each of whom faces unique challenges in the 18th century South China Sea. This screen will provide a small historical description of each coastal profession.

- Fishermen, often born into impoverished coastal communities, found themselves grappling with dwindling fish stocks and increased competition for resources. The oppressive Qing government imposed heavy taxes and regulations on their trade, pushing many into poverty. Faced with few alternatives, some fishermen turned to piracy as a desperate bid for survival and a means to escape the shackles of poverty.

- Sailors, whether on merchant vessels or imperial navy ships, contended with harsh living conditions, low wages, and the risk of encountering pirates on the high seas. Their lives were marred by the strict discipline imposed by Qing officials, and they too often found themselves ensnared in the cycle of oppression. This environment made some sailors susceptible to the allure of piracy, as it offered an opportunity for both wealth and rebellion against their oppressors.

- Peddlers, engaged in the trade of goods and commodities, faced the complexities of the Canton System's strict regulations. Profit margins were thin, and the constant threat of pirate raids further imperiled their livelihoods. Frustration with the system and the desire for financial stability sometimes led peddlers to cross over to the pirate's life, where opportunities for greater wealth and autonomy could be found.

- In "Junks & Riches," you'll experience the hardship of a working class citizen on China's coasts.

  [^1]: Most of the lower ranked pirates came from poor backgrounds such as fisherfolk and Sailors or unsuccessful traders. Pirates were typically young single men in 20s and rarely over 40. Poverty drove them to commit crimes as a way to survive and escape from the oppressive Qing government. (Antony 45 full citation needed here.)

## II. Setting and Background

### Historical Context

The game is set against the backdrop of the 18th century South China Sea Coast, a period marked by the proliferation of piracy in Chinese waters. The locations added to the game are the places most mentioned in sources talking about piracy at that time.

**1. The Canton System:**
   - The game world is deeply influenced by the Canton System, which was established by the Qing Dynasty. This system regulated foreign trade, primarily at the port of Canton (modern-day Guangzhou). Foreign merchants were restricted to conducting trade through a designated area, which was closely monitored by Qing officials. The tight control of trade created conditions conducive to smuggling, as people sought to circumvent these trade restrictions.

**2. Ports of Significance:**
   - **Macao:** Your journey begins in Macao, an essential hub for international trade. Macao's unique status as a Portuguese enclave in Chinese territory made it a haven for pirates and smugglers, operating with a degree of autonomy.
   - **Guangzhou (Canton):** This location will not be accessable in the game, because it was closed off to trade by the time the game takes place. However, macoa is the closest thing to it and acted as a place for foreigners to trade with China. Canton will be mentioned in Macao frequently.
   - **Xiamen** This port was on the coast near Taiwan and was a major trade hub for Taiwan and China. It was also somewhat near the Capitol of the Qing Dynasty, Beijing.

**3. Hainan Island - Pirate Base:**
   - Hainan Island serves as a key location in the game, housing one of the most notorious pirate bases in the region. The island's strategic position allowed pirates to operate in proximity to major trade routes. It was from this base that pirates launched their attacks on merchant ships and nearby coastal towns.

The island's strategic position allowed pirates to operate in proximity to major trade routes. It was from this base that pirates launched their attacks on merchant ships and nearby coastal towns.

**5. The Tay Son Rebellion:**
   - The Tay Son Rebellion, a historical conflict taking place during the late 18th century, provides additional context to the game world. As the rebellion swept through parts of Vietnam, it influenced the rise of several prominent pirate leaders, who played a role in the conflict. Characters will reference this rebellion, offering insights into the interconnectedness of regional events and the emergence of pirates as significant players in the power struggle.

**6. Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao and Cui Zhi:**
   - Pirate Queen Cheng I Sao and her formidable confederation of pirates, as well as the cunning and ruthless Cui Zhi, who played a crucial role in orchestrating pirate operations, are historical figures that have left a lasting impact on the region. These characters, though not likely to be encountered in the game, will be mentioned by other NPCs, contributing to the authenticity of the historical setting.

**7. The Gulf of Tonkin:**
   - The Gulf of Tonkin, a significant geographical feature, had a critical role in the operations of the pirates as a result of the Tay Son rebellion. Situated in the northern part of the South China Sea, it provided a crucial maritime passage connecting the southern coast of China with the northeastern coast of Vietnam where Chinese Pirates who joined the Tay Son rebellion could stop and trade, or get provisions and support from the rebels. This proximity allowed pirates to establish a stronghold in the Gulf of Tonkin, from which they could launch their raids on passing merchant vessels. The Gulf of Tonkin acted as a strategic arena for piracy, with its intricate network of islands, bays, and open waters providing ample opportunities for pirate operations. Hainan island was one of those islands located in the Gulf of Tonkin.
   - 
Through  dialogue and interactions with NPCs, players will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the  historical background of the 18th century South China Sea Coast, learning of the challenges and motivations that shaped the lives of Qing officials, and pirates during this era.

## III. Gameplay Mechanics
### beginning/intro
### Core Gameplay Loop
- Starting in a port near a market with an inventory based on your chosen role. 
- Daily activities of trading, acquiring food, and maintaining your crew. In order to progress, you must travel between key trading ports and pirate stashes, overcoming obstacles at sea with each journey and trading goods to increase your wealth, plundering ships, or doing contractual missions for the Qing officials or the Confederation of pirates.

### Pirate Crew Interaction
- In "Junks & Riches," you'll get the chance to join a small pirate crew early in the game. The 18th-century South China Sea was rife with desperation due to poverty, heavy taxes, and Qing government oppression, making recruitment into piracy relatively easy.
- Your choices in the game have lasting consequences. If you're not careful, both pirate and Qing officials might scrutinize your ship's identity, putting a bounty on your head. Traveling without a safe conduct pass might result in pirate attacks and cargo theft, while sailing without Qing Government registration could lead to encounters with the Qing navy and potential arrest. This reflects the harsh reality of piracy in this historical setting.

### Naval Combat
- engage in naval combat that faithfully mirrors the realities of the 18th century South China Sea. You'll take control of your ship, utilizing a top-down view and steering with WASD keys or arrow keys. Most of the controls will be point and click so a mouse is recommended for gameplay.

- **Weapons used** is the **'wallpiece,'** a swiveling cannon mounted to maximize its range of motion. Typically used at close range, these swivel guns allowed for quick adjustments of aim. Another weapon featured is the **'fowling piece,'** originally designed for bird hunting. With barrels reaching up to six feet for maximum accuracy, these long shotguns were adapted for warfare and wielded by the Chinese military and pirates alike.

There were several types of cannons, some fired larger cannonballs, some fired grapeshot, and some fired small cannonballs. The different types of cannons were used depending on the range, and the level of maneuverability needed and can each be traded for and used in combat in the game.

- **Qing Navy Cannonballs:** The cannonballs used by the Qing Navy were described as weighing "1 catty," which is approximately equivalent to 1.3 pounds. These cannonballs were used with the cannons on Qing Navy warships.

- **Pirate Cannonballs:** On the other hand, pirate ships in the region were noted to use heavier cannonballs. Specifically, the notes mentioned that pirate cannonballs weighed "14 catty," which is approximately equivalent to 18 pounds. These larger cannonballs were used with the cannons on pirate junks.

## V. Progression and Objectives

### Pirate Organizations and Communal Stash

In the 1800s South China Sea, pirate organizations were not just bands of lawless individuals but rather structured entities with their own rules, hierarchies, and a communal stash. Understanding this system is vital for players to thrive in the game.

- **Pirate Hierarchy:**
  - Pirate organizations had leaders, often referred to as "Pirate Chieftains." These leaders were responsible for making strategic decisions and assigning roles within the crew. Some pirate leaders came from merchant backgrounds, and their business acumen often made them successful.

- **Communal Stash:**
  - Pirate organizations maintained a communal stash where the plundered wealth was stored. This communal stash was a shared treasury accessible to all members, serving as a vital resource for the group's survival and expansion.

- **Wealth Accumulation:**
  - A key objective for players is to contribute to the communal stash. By accumulating wealth through various means, such as raiding ships, looting villages, or trading contraband, players strengthen their pirate organization and contribute to its growth.

- **Leaderboard:**
  - The game features a leaderboard that displays the top contributors to the communal stash. The more wealth a player accumulates and deposits into the communal stash, the higher their score on the leaderboard. Achieving a high position in the rankings grants players prestige and recognition within the pirate organization.

- **Rules and Regulations:**
  - Pirate organizations operated under a set of rules and regulations. These rules could include the division of spoils, codes of conduct, and penalties for insubordination. Players must adhere to these rules to maintain their standing within the group.

- **Decision-Making and Alliances:**
  - The communal stash could be used to make crucial decisions. Players may vote on alliances with other pirate organizations, fortifying strongholds, or choosing new targets for raids. A portion of the communal stash might be allocated to negotiating alliances, diplomacy, and defense.

- **Strategic Investments:**
  - Players can use their accumulated wealth to invest in improving the organization's infrastructure, upgrading ships, and strengthening their position within the pirate hierarchy.

In South China Pirates, the communal stash is not just a treasure chest; it's the lifeblood of the pirate organization. Players must strive to accumulate wealth, follow the rules, and work together to become legendary pirates and dominate the leaderboard.

### Historical Background and Sources
---

**Safe Conduct Passes**
: The pirate confederacy had established a structured protection racket. Even salt traders employed by the Qing state were compelled to purchase "safe conduct passes" at a cost of 200 Spanish silver dollars per vessel. These passes were obtainable at ports situated in significant trading hubs and villages, frequently in proximity to prominent political centers. This situation highlights the pervasive corruption within Qing officials and the considerable influence wielded by the confederacy.

**Postal Communication in 1800s China: Coordinating Through Letters**
: In 1800s China, people communicated primarily through private letters. Letters were delivered by friends, messengers, or urban letter shops. The origins of this system remain uncertain, but it allowed for effective coordination despite regional variations and high illiteracy rates. This decentralized approach reflected the dynamic nature of communication during the era.

**Macao**
: Macao, a prominent trading port during the 19th century, played a crucial role in the foreign trade system with China. In Canton, foreign merchants formed a separate community, while a specialized guild known as the Co-hong on the Chinese side held a monopoly over trade with these foreigners. The Co-hong merchants paid substantial sums to the hoppo for the privilege of engaging in foreign trade and profited significantly from this exclusive access. The Qing emperors, despite maintaining a certain distance from foreign traders, derived substantial personal revenue from the duties collected from trade, directly benefiting the imperial household. The foreign merchants, required to reside in a designated quarter of the city, lived in structures called "factories," which functioned as living quarters, warehouses, and trade offices. The Thirteen Factories, lining the waterfront, housed British, Austrian, Danish, Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, and American merchants, creating a vibrant and diverse trading environment. Despite fires in 1822, 1841, and 1856, leading to the relocation of the quarter to Shamian Island, Macao remained a pivotal hub in the intricate web of foreign trade with China.

### Weapons


---

**Wallpieces**
: "Wallpieces" were swiveling cannons that were mounted to allow for a good range of motion. They were typically used at close ranges and were also known as swivel guns small cannons affixed to boats.
 MacKay, Joseph.  "Pirate Nations: Maritime Pirates as Escape Societies in Late Imperial China." *Social Science History* 37, no. 4 (2013): page 117-118. [Link to Source](http://www.jstor.org/stable/24573942)

---

**Fowling Piece:**
: In the 1800s, during the era of piracy and rebellion in China, the use of firearms, particularly the "bird gun" or "fowling piece" (niaoqiang), played a distinctive role in the region's tumultuous history. The term "bird gun" likely originated from its initial use in hunting birds, but it found a place in more combative settings as well.

:  The introduction of the matchlock gun to China occurred during the Jiajing period of the Ming dynasty (1521-1567) in the early sixteenth century. Despite the transformative impact of firearms on warfare, the matchlock or bird gun did not become the predominant weapon during the Ming and Qing periods. The state's indifference towards small arms had significant implications for the circulation of these weapons in society, limiting their adoption by civilians.

: Banditry, insurgency, and rebellious activities were essential factors in assessing the prevalence of arms among the population during this time. While firearms like bird guns were not widespread among outlaws, bandits, and rebels during the Qing dynasty, they did have a presence. The Conspectus of Penal Cases, a comprehensive collection of Qing criminal cases, documented relatively few instances of bird gun homicides before the nineteenth century. Criminals with lethal intent typically favored nonexplosive weapons such as swords, knives, and daggers.

: One notable example illustrating the use of firearms during this period was the Lin Shuangwen uprising (1786-1788). Lin, a Ming loyalist and leader of the rebellion, organized a force largely composed of peasants. The rebel army equipped itself against Qing troops, showcasing a mix of weaponry. The Lin Shuangwen uprising provides insight into how rebel forces in the 1800s utilized a variety of arms, including traditional weapons like swords and nonexplosive tools, while firearms like bird guns were not as prevalent among their arsenal.
